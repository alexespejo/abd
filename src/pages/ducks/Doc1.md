# Doc 1

Based on the information provided, I have access to several parts of two PDF files:

1. "cs161-notes7.pdf" - This appears to be lecture notes or slides for a Computer Science course (CS161) covering topics in graph theory.

2. "cs161-notes2.pdf" - This seems to be another set of lecture notes or slides for the same course, but covering different topics, possibly related to sorting algorithms and data structures.

You've asked me to transpose the notes from "notes2" into markdown format with LaTeX equations where appropriate. I'll do my best to create a comprehensive review sheet based on the content from "cs161-notes2.pdf".

# CS161 - Notes 2 Review Sheet

## Basic Data Structures

- Arrays
- Dynamic arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Dictionaries
- Hash tables
- Binary trees

### Arrays

- Numbered collection of cells or entries
- Numbering usually starts at 0
- Fixed number of entries
- Accessing or modifying contents: O(1) time
- Inserting or deleting in the middle: slow

### Dynamic Arrays

- Similar to arrays, but size can be increased or decreased
- Examples: ArrayList in Java, list in Python

### Linked Lists

- Sequence of nodes
- Each node contains data and a reference to the next node

## Searching in a Sorted Array (Binary Search)

(Note: The provided document snippets don't contain detailed information about binary search. The following is a general outline.)

- Algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted array
- Time complexity: O(log n)

## Sorting Algorithms

### Insertion Sort

- Time complexity: O(n²)
- Efficient for small n or almost sorted input
- In-place sorting algorithm

Analysis:

<span class="lx-centered">

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)$$

</span>

### Selection Sort

Two variants:

1. Repeatedly find minimum, output, delete
2. Repeatedly find maximum, swap with last unsorted element

- Time complexity: O(n²)
- Can be improved using priority queues
